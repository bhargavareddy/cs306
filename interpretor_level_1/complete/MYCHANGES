Changes Done to the source code:

1) Scanner.hh--> Added the procedure for making the basic block a token.
2) Parser.hh --> parsed the basic_block to make them legitimate stings and then passed to the ast file
				 Added ast's to the program and also precedence order

3) Ast.cc --> Implemented methods for Ifelse, Goto, Comparison AST's so as to make the expressions work.
4) icode.cc --> Added the method for IC_Stmt for comparison, IF_else, GOT_stmt so that they go into execution
5) Basic_Block statement --> We need to start the BB_IC_stmt so that label's are printed for the respective cateogries
